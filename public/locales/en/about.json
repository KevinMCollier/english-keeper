    "I grew up between cultures — born in California to a Filipino-American family and later moving to small-town Arizona. That experience gave me a first-hand understanding of what it feels like to navigate language and identity in different environments. Over time, I’ve come to see language not just as communication, but as a way to connect people and share culture.",
    "After studying abroad in Europe, I moved to Japan, where I’ve now lived for more than a decade. My mission as a teacher is simple: to help Japanese professionals communicate confidently in English while keeping their own identity. I believe English isn’t about becoming “more Western” — it’s about giving you the tools to express yourself and bring Japanese culture to the world on your own terms.",
    "With an MBA, experience in IT, and a 11+ years in education, I bring a broad perspective to match where you're at today. Above all, my approach is people-first: sessions are tailored to your goals, practical for your daily life, and focused on building confidence step by step."
