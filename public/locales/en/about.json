  "story": "Growing up in an Asian-American household in Los Angeles, adapting to life in Arizona, and later living across Europe taught me how culture shapes collaboration. Now based in Tokyo, I help companies in Japan—both Japanese and international—navigate an increasingly diverse workforce. I work to preserve the best of Japanese work culture while welcoming fresh perspectives, bridging communication gaps, and turning that variety into sustainable growth. Every workplace has patterns—of behavior, motivation, and miscommunication. I help teams surface them, understand them, and shift them for good.",

  "mission": "My mission is to align people, culture, and strategy so everyone thrives."
